# learning-asm
Learning the basics of assembly. Using x86_64 with the GNU Assembler on Fedora Linux. 

Based on "Learn to Program with Assembly" by Bartlett and "Programming From the 
Ground Up" by Bruno.

## PURPOSE
Understand more about registers, the ALU, memory management, etc., by getting my hands dirty. 

## FILES

NOTE: the results from each program can be seen by using "echo $?" in the CLI.

* myexit.asm - returns an exit code.
* arithmetic.asm - shows how basic math is done. Exit code is used to deliver the final result.
* maximum.asm - takes an array of longs, finds the largest element, then returns the value via exit code.
